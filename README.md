Using elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters:  In cluster analysis, the elbow method is a heuristic used in determining the number of clusters in a data set. The method consists of plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use.The Elbow method is one of the most popular ways to find the optimal number of clusters. This method uses the concept of WCSS value. WCSS stands for Within Cluster Sum of Squares, which defines the total variations within a cluster.
